# Netmon

Let's start with a standard ping and nmap scan.

We see an FTP server is running on the machine, we can try to login using default credentials because the nmap script let us know that anonymous logins are allowed.

anonymous:anonymous

You will find the user flag in /Users/Public/Desktop/flag.txt

Use the get command to download the file to you local machine.

Knowing that we are running a network monitor application, we can use the ftp access to see if we can see any interesting information from PRTG.
